# Actions

Unity action-based library for controlling game objects through the editor

# Description

My first tought about this is to create a lean edutir action-based system for Unity in which you can describe behaviours of objects in a higher abstraction level and then use it through code.

Something that should be used by designers thorugh the editor, but developers can focus in developing those behaviours.

# Usage

Coming soon
